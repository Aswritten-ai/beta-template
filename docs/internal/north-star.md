## Focus Lock
**INACTIVE** — operating in priority stack mode.

## Priority Stack

### 1. Enterprise Pricing & GTM Pivot
**What:** Transition the commercial model from usage-based to seat-based pricing to align with top-down enterprise sales motions.
**Why now:** Enterprise procurement requires predictable line items; the current usage-based model creates friction in high-value sales cycles.
**Evidence:** Daniel established this shift during the Jan 15 call with Martin Kess, noting that "Per-seat is cleaner for enterprise." This is a direct decision with high conviction *(Daniel, Jan 15 call with Martin Kess; replaced usage-based model from Dec pitch prep)*.
**Blocks:** This enables the finalization of the sales playbook's objection-handling section and the unit economics in the VC one-pager.

### 2. Narrative Architecture Operating System
**What:** Codify the "Narrative Architecture" as the core operating system to align market opportunity, strategy, and product.
**Why now:** Without a unified narrative, product development and GTM strategy risk drift, leading to inconsistent market positioning.
**Evidence:** The ontology defines Narrative Architecture as the OS for story-led strategy, ensuring the same narrative flows from positioning to roadmap. This is a foundational concept in the collective memory graph *(Ontology: NarrativeArchitecture ConceptScheme)*.
**Blocks:** This alignment is a prerequisite for the "Glazing" phase, which involves creating Templates and Proof artifacts.

### 3. Style & Voice Calibration
**What:** Implement the Style Rubric and Voice Profiles to ensure all organizational artifacts maintain a consistent, human-centric brand voice.
**Why now:** As the organization scales, maintaining a "human" register (scoring 5 on the rubric) is critical to differentiating from "obvious AI" outputs.
**Evidence:** The StyleRubric and SpeakerIdiolects are established in the ontology to prevent narrative drift and ensure resonance *(Ontology: StyleRubric, SpeakerIdiolects)*.
**Blocks:** This enables the "Furnishing" phase, where final templates and calibration refinements are completed.

## Session Protocol

When starting a session:
- Surface the current "North Star" priorities and any active Focus Locks.
- Check for recent memory shifts (deltas) that might have changed the priority stack since the last session.

When the user asks about something off-stack:
- Acknowledge the request but flag it as "off-stack" relative to current strategic priorities.
- Ask if the user wants to proceed or redirect back to the top 3 priorities.

When work reveals new information:
- Flag the insight as a candidate for a new memory.
- If the insight challenges a "Boulder" or "Foundation" conviction level, prompt for a formal strategy review.

## Horizon

### Next 2-4 Weeks
- **Phase: Glazing**: Transition to creating high-fidelity sales decks and landing pages that reflect the new seat-based pricing and narrative alignment.
- **VC One-Pager Update**: Revise unit economics and GTM slides to reflect the enterprise pivot for upcoming fundraising signals.

### Open Questions
- How will the shift to seat-based pricing impact the TAM/SAM/SOM model for the mid-market segment?
- What specific "Stock Phrases" should be codified for the founder's idiolect to improve the Style Rubric scores in automated drafts?

## StyleRubric Evaluation

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Register Fit** | 5 | Professional, strategic, and direct. |
| **Phrasing (Idiolect)** | 4 | Uses domain-specific terms like "Focus Lock" and "Narrative Architecture." |
| **Cadence** | 5 | Short, punchy sentences suitable for a 30-second founder read. |
| **Strategic Alignment** | 5 | Directly grounded in the provided ontology and strategic pivot decisions. |
| **Audience Tailoring** | 5 | Specifically structured for a founder and an AI session. |
| **Resonance** | 4 | Uses the "North Star" and "Compass" analogies effectively. |
| **Flow** | 5 | Logical progression from immediate focus to long-term horizon. |
| **Novelty** | 4 | Avoids boilerplate by using the specific "Focus Lock" mechanism. |
| **Accuracy** | 5 | Strictly adheres to the provided snapshot and ontology. |

**Overall Score: 4.67 / 5**

## Analysis of Collective Memory

**TL;DR**: The memory is strong on structural ontology (Narrative Architecture) and recent strategic pivots (Pricing), but lacks specific "Proof" artifacts (Case Studies) and "Speaker Idiolect" details to reach a perfect human-resonance score.

### Improvements for Collective Memory
- **Add Specificity to Idiolects**: The graph defines the *concept* of Speaker Idiolects but lacks the actual "Stock Phrases" or "Signature Lines" for the founders. Adding these would allow the AI to mimic the specific "human" quirks of the leadership.
- **Populate Proof Subgraph**: While the priority stack mentions "Proof," the snapshot is thin on actual Case Study data. Adding 2-3 specific customer wins would ground the "Evidence" sections in results rather than just internal decisions.
- **Delta Tracking**: The memory would benefit from more explicit `prov:wasDerivedFrom` links between the old usage-based model and the new seat-based model to better illustrate the "Delta" in citations.

### Prompt Iteration
- **Refine the "Focus Lock" Criteria**: The prompt could benefit from a more quantitative definition of "Existential Risk" to make the Focus Lock trigger more objective.
- **Incorporate "Anti-Priorities"**: Explicitly asking for what is being *deferred* (per the assignment) would strengthen the "Focus" aspect of the document.

### Next Actions
1. **User Action**: Add a memory file (e.g., `2025-05-15-founder-voice.md`) containing direct quotes, common analogies, and "pet peeves" of the founders to populate the `SpeakerIdiolects` node.
2. **AI Action**: I can implement a "Deferred List" in the next iteration of this prompt to explicitly show what the organization is choosing *not* to do.
