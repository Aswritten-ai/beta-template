**Three Phrase (20-30 words)**
*   **Definition + mechanism + benefit:** A Narrative Architecture operating system. It captures institutional knowledge via a "witness" process. This ensures every AI output is perfectly aligned with your strategy.

**One Sentence (20-30 words)**
*   **Complete definition with outcome:** aswritten provides a collective memory that aligns market opportunity, strategy, and product so the same narrative flows from positioning to roadmap to proof. [^narrative-arch]

**Two Sentence (40-60 words)**
*   **Definition + flow:** aswritten is a Narrative Architecture operating system that captures and structures institutional knowledge. By witnessing decisions and committing them to a queryable graph, it ensures that every AI agent and team member operates from a single, canonical source of truth.

**Three Sentence (60-90 words)**
*   **Problem + solution + outcome:** Organizations suffer from narrative drift where strategy, product, and marketing fall out of sync. aswritten solves this by creating a collective memory that "witnesses" and encodes every key decision into a Git-native RDF knowledge graph. This results in total alignment, where AI agents and human teams produce consistent, strategy-led output from day one to exit.

**One Paragraph (90-150 words)**
*   **Complete pitch:** aswritten is the Narrative Architecture operating system designed to eliminate narrative drift in AI-forward organizations. Most companies lose institutional knowledge in Slack threads and undocumented calls, leading to misaligned products and generic marketing. aswritten captures these fleeting insights through a structured "witnessing" process, committing them to a Git-native collective memory. This graph-based source of truth allows AI agents to query the organization’s actual worldview, not just generic patterns. The result is a compounding advantage where onboarding time drops from months to days, and every piece of content, code, or strategy is automatically aligned with the founder's intent. It moves organizations from fragmented silos to a state of "one worldview, aligned output," ensuring that the narrative established at the site level remains true through every phase of growth. [^narrative-arch]

**Two Paragraph (150-250 words)**
*   **Extended pitch with examples:** aswritten transforms how organizations manage their most valuable asset: their institutional knowledge. By implementing a Narrative Architecture, companies can bridge the gap between high-level strategy and daily execution. The system works by "observing" organizational activity and "witnessing" key decisions—turning raw conversations into structured, queryable memories. For a creative agency, this means a new consultant can step into a client account on Day 1 with the full context of a three-year relationship. For a technical team, it ensures that coding agents implement features that align with the business's strategic "boulders," not just the immediate ticket requirements.

    The value of this collective memory compounds over time. Unlike traditional documentation like Notion or Confluence, which requires manual updates and often rots, aswritten’s memory is a living graph. It tracks the "delta" of every decision, providing a clear provenance chain from a founder's interview to a specific marketing claim. This level of transparency and alignment is critical for VCs tracking portfolio progress or CEOs managing rapid pivots. By anchoring the organization in a "Foundation" of settled convictions, aswritten ensures that as the company scales, its narrative remains sharp, its AI remains aligned, and its output remains undeniably human.

### [section] Examples

**Before/After Scenarios**
*   **Onboarding:** *Before:* New hires take 3–6 months to understand the "why" behind the product. *After:* New hires query the collective memory and are productive on Day 1 with full strategic context.
*   **Knowledge Loss:** *Before:* A key lead departs, taking the "unwritten rules" and history with them. *After:* Zero knowledge loss; every decision was witnessed and committed to the graph.
*   **Coding Agent:** *Before:* AI generates code that works but ignores the long-term architectural strategy. *After:* Agents query the "Structural Engineering" memories to ensure every line of code supports the broader roadmap.
*   **Content Generation:** *Before:* Marketing produces generic, "AI-flavored" copy that requires heavy editing. *After:* AI generates content grounded in the specific idiolect and "boulders" of the brand.
*   **Board Reporting:** *Before:* Manual, week-long compilation of metrics and updates. *After:* Auto-generated reports pulled directly from the witnessed outcomes and proof in the graph.

**Workflow Examples**
*   **The Witness Cycle:** A user **observes** a strategic shift during a call. The AI **prompts** the user to **witness** the specific decision. They **draft** the memory together, **commit** it to the Git-native witness, and it undergoes **review** before **updating** the collective worldview. [^process]

**Use Case Illustrations**
*   **Creative Agency:** Managing client knowledge across rotating teams to ensure "one voice" for every brand.
*   **Consulting Firm:** Onboarding consultants instantly by giving them access to the "site" and "foundations" of a client's narrative architecture.
*   **Digital Agency:** Maintaining code context so that AI-assisted development never drifts from the original technical strategy.
*   **VC/Board:** Tracking portfolio company progress through a transparent, queryable record of strategic pivots and proof points.

**Subject:** Is your AI drifting from your strategy?
Hi [Name],
Most CEOs I talk to are worried about "narrative drift"—the gap between the strategy you set and the output your team (and your AI) actually produces.
aswritten solves this by creating a "collective memory" for your organization. We "witness" your key decisions and encode them into a queryable graph. This means your AI agents and new hires operate with your full worldview from Day 1.
We’re running a pilot for companies like [Company Name]. Do you have 30 minutes next week to see how we can anchor your organization’s knowledge?

### Citations

[^narrative-arch]: The Narrative Architecture is defined in the ontology as the "operating system for story-led strategy," aligning market opportunity, strategy, product, and organization (NarrativeArchitecture Concept Scheme). This is a foundational concept (Foundation conviction) that ensures the same narrative flows through all organizational artifacts.

[^process]: The workflow of "observe → witness → draft → commit → review → update" is the core mechanism for capturing institutional knowledge (Process > Core Workflows). This process ensures that memories are not just recorded but validated and integrated into the organizational worldview.

### Analysis

**TL;DR:** The draft successfully translates the Narrative Architecture ontology into a functional marketing cheatsheet. It maintains high fidelity to the "witnessing" process and the "one worldview" thesis. However, the lack of specific pilot metrics and case study details in the current snapshot necessitates the use of "[pending]" placeholders, which limits the "Proof" section's effectiveness.

**Improvements for Collective Memory:**
1.  **Add Proof Artifacts:** The "Proof" and "Case Studies" sections are currently thin. Adding memories of specific pilot outcomes, quantified time-savings, and direct customer quotes would allow for a much stronger "Results" section.
2.  **Expand Idiolect/Style:** While the ontology defines "Style," more specific examples of "Stock Phrases" or "Metaphors" used by the founders would help the "Pitches" feel more unique and less formulaic.
3.  **Detail Audience Pains:** More granular memories regarding the specific "nightmare scenarios" for PMs or Sales teams would allow for better tailoring of the audience-specific value props.

**Prompt Iteration:**
The next iteration of this prompt could focus on generating a **"Sales Playbook"** that takes these cheatsheet elements and puts them into specific conversational scripts, objection-handling routines, and demo flow storyboards.

**Next Actions:**
1.  **User:** Add memories regarding the first pilot results and specific founder quotes to resolve the [pending] tags.
2.  **storyWRITER:** Offer to generate the **Sales Playbook** once the proof artifacts are added to the memory.
