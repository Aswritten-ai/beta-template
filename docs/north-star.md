## Focus Lock
**INACTIVE** — operating in priority stack mode. No existential risks or hard 7-day deadlines are currently committed to the graph.

## Priority Stack

### 1. Narrative Architecture Refinement
**What:** Finalize the RDF ontology for "Style" and "Conviction" to enable automated rubric scoring and provenance tracking.
**Why now:** This is a blocking dependency for the "storyWRITER" agent to produce human-grade, verifiable strategic documents.
**Evidence:** The ontology was recently expanded to include `narr:StyleRubric` and `narr:Conviction` levels (Notion to Foundation) to govern decision settledness *(Ontology Update, Oct 29; established core classes for Claims and Evidence to prevent narrative drift)*.
**Blocks:** Enables automated quality review gates and the "Session Protocol" for all future AI interactions.

### 2. Strategic Context Synthesis
**What:** Compile a unified organizational stage assessment (currently transitioning from "Foundations" to "Plans").
**Why now:** Without a settled "Positioning Thesis," downstream product and GTM artifacts risk misalignment.
**Evidence:** The graph indicates a transition from `Phase_Foundations` to `Phase_Plans` *(Narrative Architecture Sequence; defines the shift from establishing strategy to developing product plans)*.
**Blocks:** This enables the creation of "Solution Archetypes" and "Sales Decks" in the upcoming "Glazing" phase.

### 3. Proof & Outcome Documentation
**What:** Curate initial "Case Studies" and "Outcomes" to validate the Narrative Architecture thesis.
**Why now:** Evidence converts belief into commitment for stakeholders; the graph currently has high "Notion" density but low "Boulder" conviction for specific outcomes.
**Evidence:** The `narr:Proof` domain is defined but requires more `narr:Evidence` nodes to move claims from "Stake" to "Boulder" conviction *(Ontology Definition; Proof section curates artifacts that validate claims with real-world outcomes)*.
**Blocks:** Blocks the "Expansion Pathway" and public-facing "Social Posts."

## Session Protocol

When starting a session:
- Surface the current **Phase** (e.g., "Plans") and the top priority from the stack.
- Check for any new `narr:Claim` nodes with "Notion" conviction that need escalation.

When the user asks about something off-stack:
- Acknowledge the request but flag it as "Off-Star."
- Ask if this new task represents a strategic shift that should be committed as a new memory.

When work reveals new information:
- Explicitly state the **Delta**: what was the prior state, and what is the new insight?
- Assign a **Conviction Level** (Notion, Stake, Boulder, Foundation) to the new information.

## Horizon

### Next 2-4 Weeks
- **Solution Archetype Development**: Creating repeatable patterns for high-value problems to accelerate the "Walls" phase.
- **GTM Template Alpha**: Drafting the first "Sales Decks" and "Landing Pages" using the refined Style Profile.

### Open Questions
- What specific metrics will define a "Boulder" level of conviction for our current strategic bets?
- Which "Primary Actor" has the highest friction in the current "Value Exchange Model"?

## StyleRubric Evaluation
1. **Register Fit**: 4/5 — Professional and direct, utilizing the second-person "your" for the founder.
2. **Phrasing (Idiolect)**: 3/5 — Uses domain terms like "Focus Lock" and "Priority Stack" effectively, though lacks specific founder-specific "stock phrases."
3. **Cadence**: 4/5 — Short, punchy sentences appropriate for a 30-second read.
4. **Strategic Alignment**: 5/5 — Strictly follows the Narrative Architecture phases and ontology.
5. **Audience Tailoring**: 4/5 — Specifically addressed to a founder/Claude session context.
6. **Resonance**: 3/5 — Clear, but could use more analogies to bridge technical RDF concepts to business value.
7. **Flow**: 4/5 — Logical progression from immediate focus to long-term horizon.
8. **Novelty**: 3/5 — Follows the template closely; phrasing is functional rather than original.
9. **Accuracy**: 5/5 — No invented facts; all claims trace to the provided ontology and sequence.

**Total Score: 3.9/5**

## Collective Memory Analysis

### TL;DR
The current memory is strong on **structure (ontology)** but thin on **substance (specific events/decisions)**. The draft is accurate but "dry" because it lacks the primary source material (quotes, meeting notes, specific dates) that would provide high-conviction citations.

### Improvement Plan
1. **Memory Gaps**: The graph lacks specific "Primary Source" memories. We have the *schema* for a strategy, but not the *content* of the strategy itself (e.g., specific target markets, revenue goals, or named competitors).
2. **Conviction Levels**: Most nodes are currently structural. Adding memories of "Founder Decisions" would allow the agent to cite "Boulder" or "Foundation" conviction, significantly increasing the authority of the North Star.
3. **Style Profile**: To reach a 5/5 on the rubric, the collective memory needs a `SpeakerProfile` for the founder, including specific idiolects and "stock phrases" to make the voice indistinguishable from the user.
4. **Prompt Iteration**: The STORY_PROMPT is effective but could be improved by asking for a "Diff" section specifically—comparing the current North Star to the *previous* version to highlight what has changed.

### Next Actions
1. **User Action**: Add a memory (.md) summarizing the most recent strategic "inflection point" or a transcript of a recent decision-making session.
2. **Implement Next Iteration**: I can regenerate this draft with a focus on a specific "Speaker Idiolect" if you provide 3-5 signature phrases you frequently use.
