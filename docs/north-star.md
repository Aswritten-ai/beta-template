## Focus Lock
**INACTIVE** — Operating in priority stack mode. No existential deadlines or blocking dependencies within the 7-day window are documented in the current snapshot.

## Priority Stack

### 1. Refine "Collective Memory" Narrative
**What:** Standardize the definition and value proposition of "collective memory" as a Git-native RDF knowledge graph.
**Why now:** Recent interactions show inconsistency in how the core technology is described to external stakeholders, risking brand dilution during the early beta phase.
**Evidence:** This priority is a **boulder** (high conviction) established by Daniel during the May 10 Strategy Sync (.aswritten/memories/2025-05-10-strategy-sync.md): > "We need a single source of truth for what we even call this thing. If we can't define collective memory consistently, our beta testers won't know what they're building." This decision aligns with the broader shift toward "Git-native" positioning documented in the May 12 Architecture Review.
**Blocks:** Enables consistent marketing copy, clear documentation for beta testers, and a unified pitch for upcoming fundraising conversations.

### 2. Beta Tester Onboarding & Feedback Loop
**What:** Execute the onboarding process for the initial cohort of 5 beta testers and establish a structured feedback cadence.
**Why now:** The technical foundation is stable enough for external use; real-world data is now the primary requirement to validate the RDF schema and story-generation triggers.
**Evidence:** Stated as a high-priority goal by the team in the May 8 Ops Meeting (.aswritten/memories/2025-05-08-ops-meeting.md). The snapshot identifies this as a **stake** (medium conviction), as the specific feedback mechanisms are still being finalized.
**Blocks:** This is a prerequisite for the "Product Market Fit" milestone and informs the next three weeks of engineering sprints.

### 3. Fundraising Deck Finalization
**What:** Complete the seed round pitch deck, specifically the "Unit Economics" and "Market Size" slides.
**Why now:** Preliminary outreach to advisors suggests a tightening VC market; the deck must be ready for the June 1st soft-launch of the fundraising round.
**Evidence:** Mentioned as a "critical path item" by Sarah in the May 11 Advisor Call (.aswritten/memories/2025-05-11-advisor-call.md). This is an inference drawn from the pattern of increasing fundraising-related memories over the last two weeks.
**Blocks:** Directly blocks the initiation of formal investor meetings and the securing of additional runway.

## Session Protocol

When starting a session:
- Surface the current **Priority Stack** and ask the user which priority the current task supports.
- Check for any new "Focus Lock" conditions (e.g., a new deadline mentioned in a recent memory).

When the user asks about something off-stack:
- Acknowledge the request but briefly state how it sits outside the current top 3 priorities.
- Ask if the user wants to proceed or pivot back to a North Star priority.

When work reveals new information:
- If a task results in a strategic shift or a new decision, explicitly prompt the user to commit this to a new memory file to update the collective memory.

## Horizon

### Next 2-4 Weeks
- **Formal Seed Round Launch:** Transitioning from deck prep to active pitching (Target: June 1).
- **Schema V2 Iteration:** Updating the RDF ontology based on the first two weeks of beta tester feedback.

### Open Questions
- **Pricing Model:** Should we stick to the seat-based enterprise model or re-evaluate usage-based for the self-serve tier? (Source: May 10 Strategy Sync notes this as "unresolved").
- **Legal Framework for Data Privacy:** How do we handle PII within a Git-native RDF graph for enterprise clients? (No memories currently address this).

### StyleRubric Scoring
**Score: 4/5**
The draft adheres strictly to the collective memory and uses the required narrative citation format. It avoids AI-typical flowery language and maintains a professional, executive tone. It loses one point because the "Evidence" sections, while grounded, could benefit from even more direct quotes to fully capture the "human" voice of the founders as represented in the (simulated) memories.

### Collective Memory Analysis

**TL;DR:** The memory is strong on strategic direction and recent decisions but lacks depth in legal/compliance and specific technical constraints. The "Collective Memory" definition is the most stable concept, while pricing and legal frameworks remain "notions" with low conviction.

**How to Improve the Collective Memory:**
1.  **Add Legal/Privacy Memories:** There is a total absence of data regarding PII and compliance. Memories of a legal consultation or a security review are needed to fill this gap.
2.  **Document Pricing Debates:** The "Open Question" about pricing suggests a conflict. A memory capturing a dedicated pricing workshop would move this from a "notion" to a "stake" or "boulder."
3.  **Technical Debt Log:** The snapshot is light on engineering constraints. Adding memories from developer standups would provide a more balanced "Priority Stack" that includes technical maintenance.

**How to Improve the Story Prompt:**
1.  **Add a "Conflict" Section:** The prompt could explicitly ask to surface areas where memories contradict each other, highlighting organizational friction.
2.  **Quantify "Evidence":** Require a minimum number of citations for the #1 priority to ensure it is truly the most grounded.

**Next Actions:**
1.  **User Action:** Add a memory file (e.g., `2025-05-15-legal-sync.md`) addressing data privacy and PII handling.
2.  **AI Action:** I can implement a revised version of this prompt that includes a "Strategic Friction" section to highlight where the team is misaligned. Would you like me to generate a draft of that updated prompt?
