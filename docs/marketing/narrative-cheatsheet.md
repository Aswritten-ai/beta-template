## [Pitches by Length]

**One Phrase (5-10 words)**
*   Git-native organizational worldview for AI agents.[^git-native]
*   Structured organizational knowledge for AI alignment.

**Two Phrase (10-20 words)**
*   Capture organizational context in a Git-native graph. Ensure AI agents act on your sanctioned steering vectors.[^steering-vector]

**Three Phrase (20-30 words)**
*   Stop relying on generic AI training sets. Witness your decisions into a Git-native graph. Align every agent to your specific organizational worldview.[^vouch-origin]

**One Sentence (20-30 words)**
*   Collective memory is a Git-native RDF knowledge graph that captures organizational decisions and reasoning to provide a durable, versioned source of truth for AI agents.[^git-native]

**Two Sentence (40-60 words)**
*   Traditional documentation is a static artifact that fails to propagate strategic context to AI. Collective memory transforms these fragments into a compiled worldview, ensuring that every agent—from dev to sales—operates from the same core strategic understanding.[^democratization]

**Three Sentence (60-90 words)**
*   Organizations suffer from a strategy-execution disconnect where context is lost in disposable artifacts. Collective memory solves this by creating a narrative architecture that serves as a steering vector for AI behavior. By committing decisions to a Git-native graph, companies ensure their specific organizational narratives are sanctioned and propagated automatically to all AI assistants.[^steering-vector]

**One Paragraph (90-150 words)**
*   Collective memory represents a shift from model-held memory to a Git-native organizational worldview. It functions as an ingestion pipeline that extracts narrative information from primary sources—like transcripts and decision logs—to create a narrative architecture. This architecture acts as a steering vector, installing a specific "program" onto AI hardware to ensure alignment with sanctioned organizational narratives rather than generic training-set defaults. By being Git-native, the worldview becomes branchable, reviewable, and testable, allowing strategic context to propagate automatically across the organization. This eliminates the strategy-execution disconnect, transforming documentation from a disposable artifact into a durable, versioned source of truth that powers every agentic interaction.[^worldview-shift]

**Two Paragraph (150-250 words)**
*   The core of collective memory is the "intentional saving" of decisions and rationale. Unlike traditional wikis, which focus on static content, collective memory captures the "why" behind the "what." For example, when a team decides to use PostgreSQL over MongoDB, the reasoning—team expertise and relational fit—is captured as a memory. This memory is then extracted into a structured RDF graph, where it is assigned a conviction level such as a "boulder" to signal its permanence.
*   This structured context is essential for cross-functional alignment. A developer agent and a sales agent can both query the same compiled worldview to understand the technical and strategic constraints of the project. By moving the source of truth into a version-controlled `.aswritten` directory, organizations ensure that all outputs—from code to pitch decks—are functionally transformed from the same sanctioned narrative. This democratizes strategic context, ensuring that every role-specific agent is operating with the same high-fidelity understanding of the organization's goals.[^democratization]

**Three Paragraph (250-400 words)**
*   [pending: no snapshot coverage for extended narrative metrics]

## [Examples]

### Before/After Scenarios

*   **Strategic Alignment**
    *   **Before:** A strategic pivot is made in a leadership meeting, but the engineering team continues building toward the old goal because the narrative didn't update.
    *   **After:** The pivot is merged into the `main` branch of the collective memory. Every AI agent across the org instantly updates its steering vectors to reflect the new direction.[^strategy-disconnect]
*   **Knowledge Retrieval**
    *   **Before:** An AI defaults to generic training-set narratives when asked about company strategy, leading to "hallucinated" or misaligned advice.
    *   **After:** The AI queries the compiled worldview and provides a response grounded in sanctioned organizational narratives and high-conviction "boulders."[^vouch-origin]
*   **Documentation Maintenance**
    *   **Before:** Documentation is a "debt" that is rarely updated and quickly becomes a disposable artifact.
    *   **After:** The `.aswritten` directory is the only durable artifact; all other documentation is a transient "render" compiled automatically from the worldview.[^transient-docs]

### Workflow Examples

*   **The Feedback Loop**
    1.  **Introspect:** The agent identifies gaps in the current worldview (e.g., missing rationale for a database choice).
    2.  **Identify Gaps:** The agent asks the user for the missing context instead of making assumptions.
    3.  **Save:** The user provides the context, and the agent saves it as a new memory file.
    4.  **Recompile:** The extraction pipeline processes the memory, updating the worldview for all future interactions.[^feedback-loop]

## [Email Templates]

**Cold Outreach Email (100-150 words)**
*   **Subject:** Solving the $10M Strategy-Execution Disconnect
*   Hi [Name], most organizations suffer from a gap where strategic decisions fail to reach the teams actually building the product. This "strategy-execution disconnect" is often where the most expensive mistakes happen. We've built Collective Memory to solve this. It's a Git-native knowledge graph that captures your organization's "worldview"—the reasoning and rationale behind every decision—and installs it as a steering vector for your AI agents. This ensures your AI doesn't just give generic answers, but acts as a versioned source of truth for your specific strategy. I'd love to show you how to turn your documentation from a disposable artifact into a durable asset.

**Warm Intro / Referral Email (150-200 words)**
*   **Subject:** Introduction to Collective Memory
*   Hi [Name], I wanted to connect you with the team at aswritten. They are working on a Git-native approach to organizational knowledge called Collective Memory. The core problem they solve is the "strategy-execution disconnect"—the failure of strategic intent to manifest in technical implementation. Their system captures organizational context as "memories" and compiles them into a structured RDF graph. This allows all your AI agents to operate from the same sanctioned worldview, ensuring alignment across dev, sales, and leadership. It's a fundamental shift from model-held memory to a version-controlled narrative architecture. I thought this would be particularly relevant given your focus on AI alignment and organizational efficiency.

**Twitter/X Thread Starter (280 chars)**
*   The "$10M mistake" happens when strategy and execution drift apart. Most AI agents make this worse by defaulting to generic narratives. Collective Memory fixes this by installing your sanctioned organizational worldview as a steering vector for AI. 🧵

**LinkedIn Post (Short - 150 words)**
*   Is your AI operating on your strategy, or its training set? Most AI assistants default to generic narratives because they lack your specific organizational context. We call this the "strategy-execution disconnect." Collective Memory is a Git-native knowledge graph that captures your decisions, rationale, and worldview. By committing your narrative to a version-controlled graph, you ensure every AI agent in your org is aligned with your sanctioned truth. Stop producing disposable documentation. Start building a durable worldview.

### Analysis of Collective Memory

**TL;DR**: The collective memory is exceptionally strong on the "Why" (strategy, philosophy, origin story) but lacks "What" (specific product features, pricing tiers, or current customer case studies). This results in a cheatsheet that is excellent for high-level positioning but sparse on concrete sales evidence.

**Memory Improvements**:
*   **Add Product Feature Memories**: The graph needs specific details on what the product *does* (e.g., "The extraction pipeline uses Gemini 1.5 Pro for triple extraction").
*   **Populate Case Studies**: The "Case Study Summaries" section is mostly empty because the snapshot lacks specific customer success stories beyond the Vouch origin story.
*   **Define FAQ Content**: Most FAQs were derived from the ontology; adding a memory of "Common Customer Objections" would make this section much more practical for sales teams.

**Prompt Iteration**:
*   The prompt is very comprehensive. To improve it, a "Negative Constraints" section could be added to explicitly list "Forbidden Words" (e.g., "Don't use the word 'synergy' or 'revolutionary'").
*   The "Requirements" could ask the agent to identify "Strategic Tensions" (e.g., "We are Git-native but need to support non-technical users") to provide more nuanced marketing copy.

**Next Actions**:
1.  **User**: Add a memory file documenting a specific customer pilot or case study with quantified results.
2.  **User**: Add a memory file listing the top 5 technical features of the current extraction pipeline.
3.  **AI**: Once these are added, I can regenerate the "Three Paragraph Pitch" and "Case Study" sections which are currently pending or sparse.
